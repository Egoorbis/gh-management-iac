# 🚀 GitHub Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

This repository serves as the **Central Governance Engine** for my GitHub portfolio. It uses Terraform and GitHub Apps to automate the lifecycle of my technical projects, ensuring every repository follows best practices from Day Zero.

## 🏗️ Architecture
- **Tooling:** Terraform (HCL)
- **Authentication:** GitHub App (Fine-grained permissions)
- **Security:** Automated Branch Protections, Secret Scanning, and Vulnerability Alerts.



## 🛠️ How it Works
New repositories are defined as modules within this project. By running the Terraform pipeline, I can:
1. Provision a new repository with a standardized description and topics.
2. Enforce **Branch Protection Rules** (No direct pushes to `main`).
3. Inject **GitHub Actions Secrets** (Azure/AWS Credentials) automatically.

## 🔐 Required Secrets
The workflow requires the following GitHub secrets to be configured:
- **Azure Backend**: `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `BACKEND_RESOURCE_GROUP`, `BACKEND_STORAGE_ACCOUNT`, `BACKEND_CONTAINER`, `BACKEND_KEY`
- **GitHub App**: `GH_APP_ID`, `GH_APP_INSTALLATION_ID`, `GH_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`

## 🔄 Workflow Behavior
- **Pull Requests**: Validates Terraform syntax and formatting without connecting to Azure backend
- **Push to Main**: Initializes Terraform with Azure backend, creates plan, and applies changes
- **Manual Trigger**: Same as push to main

Note: Azure OIDC federated identity must be configured for push events to main branch.

## 📂 Structure
- `/modules/repository`: The reusable blueprint for all my project repos.
- `/projects`: The live configuration where repositories are instantiated.
